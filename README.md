#### Created and Maintained by Matt Vicari
	
----------------
DogMatch v2 Blazor App (Blazor WebAssembly (WASM), Progressive Web App (PWA), .Net Core 5, SQL Server)

Dog Match is a social application for dog owners to find other dogs and dog owners that would be good matches for dog playdates, social dog walks, and more. 
The unique dog temperament and personality matching can find other dogs in your area for your dog to meet.

### Code (projects):
1. Client: Blazor WebAssembly Client SPA (WASM Progressive web Application)
2. Domain: Business Logic Layer (BLL Services), Data Repository Layer (uses Entity Framework Core 5.x)
3. Server: WebApi Controllers, Identity Server, etc.
4. Shared: Global enums, models, and DTOs

#### The original DogMatch React/Node.js/Express/MongoDB (MERN) application has been completely rewritten, redesigned, and enhanced using Blazor WASM, .Net Core 5, and SQL Server.

## Compiling Application
### Configure SQL server database (uses Entity Framework Core code first approach)
  1. Create new SQL Server database, named 'DogMatch' and update appsettings.json file in DogMatch.Server project with SQL credentials (and any changes to SQL configuration), 
  SQL credentials must have data read and write permissions (to write from EF Core).
  2. Using Visual Studio Package Manager console (pointed to the domain project, where Entity DB context exists) run 'Add-Migration' to create initial database migration script.
  3. Run â€˜Update-Database' to generate database from code first EF Core context in domain data layer.
### Additional Steps:
  1.	For image uploads (dog profile and dog album images), create two file paths (directories), one for the dog profile images, and one for the dog album images. Images will be served from DogMatch.Server, update appsettings.config file with both file paths. 
### To Debug: 
  1. In Visual Studio, set DogMatch.Server as startup project and run IIS, and attach to your favorite browser. Create new owner accounts, new dogs, and start finding the best matches for your dog!

  * New features include:
    * New Dog Matching domain service:
      * Gets all possible matches (completed dog profiles only) for a primary dog
      * Filters them down to a list of the top 10 matches based on quality of match using match scores derived from temperament ratings, basic details, and other demographics provided by a dog owner

      * Additional information regarding the matching logic can be found in the comments/documentation of the domain matching service
    * New dog matching WebApi controller
    * New domain repository methods for getting dogs with completed profiles only (for possible matches)

      * Dog Matches modal displays (up to) the top 10 matches for a primary dog, with some basic demographics for the matched dogs and button navigation to the matches profile
